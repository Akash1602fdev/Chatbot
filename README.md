This is a simple chatbot project created using the Python programming language and the Tkinter library for the GUI interface. The chatbot responds to user input by using pre-defined responses for a set of specific questions and phrases. The responses are stored in a dictionary and selected at random based on the user's input. The chatbot's purpose is to answer questions and chat with the user. The graphical user interface includes a text box for the chat history, an entry field for the user to enter their questions, and a button to initiate the chatbot's response.
